1. not sure about both at once, but yes individually (if question is asking about individually, just have all weights be 1, set threshold to 7.5)
both at once, i think NOT - need more neurons to do the OR. there can only be one threshold, so we can only tell one of the two but not both at once

2. YES. w1, w2, w3 = 1/3; w4...w9 = -1/6, threshold = 0

3. probably not. how to prove?

perceptrons can only provide linear decision boundaries and there is no linear separator that separates out all possible paths from nonpaths

(think about feature transformations ..)
